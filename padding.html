        <h1>ANDREW TATE</h1>
        <div>
            Emory Andrew Tate III (born 1 December 1986) is an American-British media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. He began practicing kickboxing in 2005 and gained his first championship in 2009. He attracted wider attention in 2016 when he appeared on the British reality show Big Brother. He was removed from the show after a video emerged of Tate repeatedly striking a woman with a belt; the two later stated the act was consensual. He began operating a camgirl business and selling online courses, and rose to fame as an internet celebrity, promoting an "ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle". Tate's misogynistic commentary has resulted in his suspension from various social media platforms.
